## Coffee Machine

### Description
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. 
It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. 
In this project, I've created a coffee machine simulator. 
The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups. If it runs out of something, it displays a notification. 
This coffee machine simulator has the following features:
- You may choose either to buy coffee, fill the machine, display quantity, or collect money
- You get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, or latte

## Hangman

### Description
Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. 
This is a recreation of the original game "Hangman" where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, with a given limited number of attempts. 
Good luck with guessing!
